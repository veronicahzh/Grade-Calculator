# Grade Tracker Application
## Term Project Proposal

**What will the application do?**
The application will calculate grades based on the user's input. It will allow users to:
- Enter weightings and grade categories such as assignments, tests, labs, and participation.
- Organize grades by timelines (current term, any semester, or any year).
- Classify courses into categories, such as required (e.g., CS major courses) or electives.
- Store class information, including course codes (e.g., CPSC, MATH) and levels (e.g., CPSC 110, CPSC 210).
- Allow multiple users to create different profiles within the same application .

**Who will use it?**
This application is designed for *students* who want to track and analyze their academic performance.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**
I am personally interested in this project because I enjoy keeping track of my grades. Instead of relying on spreadsheets and manual calculations, I want to build an application that manages everything in one place, making it easier to monitor academic progress efficiently.
